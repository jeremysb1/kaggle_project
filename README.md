# kaggle_project

These are a variety of projects to get familiar with: 

- importing data
- cleaning data
- prepping data
- using Python libraries to visualize data
- ML tools like scikit-learn
- testing and training data with ML algorithms

Libraries used include: 

- Bokeh for making interactive visualizations (https://bokeh.org/)
- Pandas to analyze data (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Numpy to work with multi-dimensional arrays (https://numpy.org/)
- scikit-learn to implement machine learning models (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)


Here is a project to measure Soccer player salaries vs. value to determine who would be a good free agent to sign.

I used Python and Bokeh to make an interactive visualization.
